	:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
	    Receiving a file from another User
	:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Step1. 
Login to the Unix system via putty or desired program. 
You are now in your home directory.

Step2.
Change the permissions for the overall user folder, that
way another user can enter to move a file.
Type "chmod g+rwx /home/student/kirby.campbell"

Step3.
Create a temp folder for another user to put files into.
Type "mkdir temp" from the home directory.

Step4.
Change permissions to your temp folder.
Type "chmod g+rwx temp"

Step5.
Type "ls -l" to see the permissions of all files within your home folder. 
temp should show drwxrwxrwx which means other users in 
your group now have the ability to read and write anywhere in your directory.

	:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
	Giving a user access to another user's file
	:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Step1. 
Login to the Unix system via putty or desired program. 
You are now in your home directory.

Step2. 
First create a file to share. 
For Example type "vim myFile" press "i" and then type your text. 
Press "Escape" and then "Shift+ZZ" to save and close the vim text editor.

Step3. 
Create a directory named temp by typing "mkdir temp" in your home directory.

Step4. Move your "myFile" to your temp directory by typing "mv myFile temp". 
now type "cd temp" to enter the temp directory.

Step5. To check the current permissions on your file type "ls -l myFile" 
- which should return 
"-rw------- 1 user.name students 26 Jan 28 11:48 myFile" in the CLI of putty.

Step6. Change the permissions of the file so 
that UserB can read and write to the file. 
Type "chmod g+rwx myFile" . Type "ls -l myFile" to see the new file permissions.

Step7. 
If UserB has already created their accessible temp folder, 
it is time to hardlink the file to their temp folder.
From within the temp folder:
Type "ln myFile /home/student/christabel.escarez/cs140u/temp/myFile"

Step8.
Christabel (UserB) can now login, cd into their temp folder, and 
type "ls -l" to see the permissions of the file linked there.
Or She can cat myFile or vim myFile to edit it.
